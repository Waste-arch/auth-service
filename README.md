# Auth Service
This repository contains a basic authentication service implemented using TypeScript/JavaScript. The project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend. The backend is built with Express, bcrypt for password hashing, and jsonwebtoken for generating tokens. The frontend is a simple React application that interacts with the backend to authenticate users.

## Getting Started
### Backend Setup:
1. Navigate to the backend directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the server with node server.js (or ts-node server.ts if using TypeScript).

### Frontend Setup:
1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the frontend with npm start.

### Note
This project is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate a simple authentication flow. In a production environment, additional security measures should be implemented, such as HTTPS, secure token storage, and more sophisticated error handling.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for improvements or bug fixes.
